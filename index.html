        For many people, these sounds don’t appear during busy daytime hours — they tend to show up late at night, when everything is quiet and the mind is finally trying to rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many adults report noticing subtle ringing, buzzing, or humming sounds, particularly in calm environments. While the experience can vary from person to person, it often leads people to search for answers and reassurance.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to health professionals, hearing comfort may be influenced by a combination of lifestyle habits, environmental exposure, and natural age-related changes over time.
